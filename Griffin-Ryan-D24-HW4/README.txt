1. The ForwardElimination algorithm fails to provide a solution for the given system due to inadequate pivoting. The BetterForwardElimination algorithm adresses this issue by implementing a more robust pivoting strategy.

2. The BetterForwardElimination algorithm fails to provide a solution for the given system because it encounters a dependency between variables during the elimination process, which prevents it from isolating each variable on its own. To fix this the algorithm could be modified with a different pivoting strategy to handle dependencies more effectively.
