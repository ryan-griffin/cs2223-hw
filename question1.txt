"Double Trouble" is a variation of the classic combinatorial game Nim, where players strategically remove objects from heaps to win. Charles L. Bouton solved Nim in 1901, providing optimal strategies for winning. This game has appeared in various forms of popular culture, including the 1961 French film Last Year at Marienbad. Nim is also often used as an educational tool for teaching mathematical thinking and game theory.
